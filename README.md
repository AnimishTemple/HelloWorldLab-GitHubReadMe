Project: HelloWorldLab

Purpose: HelloWorldLab dynamically changes the text size of the statement "Air Supply is the best band EVER!" by what the user has selected.

Value: HelloWorldLab is useful, because it demonstrates a very useful uitlity of dynamic user selection to affect the behavior of an Android app.

Get Started: Others can get started with HelloWorldLab and understand its functionality by forking the repo and running it locally in Android Studio.

It's maintained as a demo of a fundamental aspect of all Android apps (listening on a button clicked to take the result and do something with it) and anyone can build upon it for
improving their own understanding.

Here's is a screenshot of the project's output:
